        <h2 class="w3-wide">Birth</h2>
        <!-- Your content/stories go here -->
        <p>There are two main versions of the story of Ayyappa Swamy's birth.</p>
        <p>

            **The first version** is the more popular one, and it is found in the Sribhutanatha Purana. According to this story, Ayyappa is the son of Shiva and Mohini, an avatar of Vishnu.
            
            The story begins with the churning of the ocean of milk. During this churning, a number of powerful beings emerged, including the asura Bhasmasura. Bhasmasura was granted a boon by Brahma that whoever he placed his hand on would be turned to ashes.
            
            Bhasmasura soon became intoxicated with his power, and he began to wreak havoc on the world. He even tried to burn Shiva to ashes. Shiva fled, but Bhasmasura was in hot pursuit.
            
            In desperation, Shiva turned to Vishnu for help. Vishnu took the form of Mohini, a beautiful enchantress. Mohini was able to distract Bhasmasura, and she tricked him into placing his hand on his own head. Bhasmasura was immediately turned to ashes, and the world was saved.
            
            After Bhasmasura was defeated, Shiva and Mohini united, and Ayyappa was born. Ayyappa was a powerful child, and he soon grew into a handsome young man.
            
            One day, Ayyappa was hunting in the forest when he came across a tigress. The tigress was about to attack a young woman, but Ayyappa intervened and killed the tigress. The young woman was so grateful that she asked Ayyappa to marry her. Ayyappa agreed, and they were married soon after.
            
            Ayyappa and his wife lived happily together for many years. They had a son named Dharmasastha, who grew up to be a great warrior.
            
            One day, Ayyappa's wife was killed by a demon. Ayyappa was so grief-stricken that he decided to renounce the world. He left his kingdom and went into the forest to live as a hermit.
            
            Ayyappa spent many years meditating in the forest. He eventually attained enlightenment, and he became a powerful yogi.
            
            Ayyappa is still worshipped by millions of people around the world. He is considered to be a symbol of strength, courage, and devotion.

        <p>
            **The second version** of the story of Ayyappa Swamy's birth is found in the Malayalam folk songs. According to this story, Ayyappa is a historical figure who was born in the royal family of Pandala, a small kingdom located in Kerala.
            
            The story begins with the king of Pandala, who was childless. He and his wife prayed to the gods for a child, and their prayers were answered. The queen gave birth to a baby boy, who was named Manikantha.
            
            Manikantha grew up to be a handsome and intelligent young man. He was also a skilled warrior.
            
            One day, Manikantha's father decided to anoint him as the heir to the throne. However, the queen objected, as she wanted her own son to be the heir.
            
            The queen accused Manikantha of being a changeling, and she demanded that he be tested. Manikantha agreed to the test, and he successfully passed it.
            
            The queen was still not satisfied, and she demanded that Manikantha be killed. The king was reluctant to kill his own son, but he eventually agreed.
            
            Manikantha was taken to the forest and killed. However, he did not die. Instead, he was transformed into a deity.
            
            Ayyappa Swamy is still worshipped by millions of people around the world. He is considered to be a symbol of strength, courage, and devotion.</p>
